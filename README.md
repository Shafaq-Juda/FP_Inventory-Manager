# Code Review

## Documentation
- Good, concise description of the app
- Lacking setup and installation instructions documentation that would help a new developer onboard to your project
- Missing contribution guidelines? What can a new developer do to contribute.

## Version Control
- Good branching 
- Great, descriptive commit messages
- Missing issue tracking in github. Best practice is to create issue & link to pull request

## Code Hygiene
- On route file, great use of `unathenticated` block
- Code is very readable! Good indentation and spacing throughout. Great job
- Remove duplicate routes
- Remove commented out code/line

## Backend
- Sample data task is currently not working when we fork repo
- No security or authorization practices were implemented. 

## Frontend
- Improve mobile responsivity; app doesn't scale to mobile screen sizes
- Inconsistent use of rails view helpers, especially link_to

## Deployment
- Good custom domain name
